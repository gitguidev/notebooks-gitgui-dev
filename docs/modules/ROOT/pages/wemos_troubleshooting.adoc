== Uploading to wemos is not working

The last time uploading to wemos was not working on Ubuntu was a problem with the kernel:

With the version 5.11.0-36 is working fine: linux-image-5.11.0-36-generic

I found the solution here:

So, to set the default version in Grub I did:

To configure APT to keep the version I did:
